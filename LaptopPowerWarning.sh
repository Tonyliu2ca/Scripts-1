MSG="Your battery is at $currentPercentage% 

For proper maintenance of a lithium-based battery, itâ€™s important to keep the electrons in
it moving occasionally. 

Apple does not recommend leaving your portable plugged in all the
time. 

An ideal use would be a commuter who uses her notebook on the train, then plugs it
in at the office to charge. This keeps the battery juices flowing. 

Apple recommends charging and discharging its battery at least once per month

Please unplug the power cord and run off the battery for a bit.


               Thank you
